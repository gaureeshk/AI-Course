\section*{Problem Statement: }
An urn contains 25 balls of which 10 balls
bear a mark ’X’ and the remaining 15 bear a
mark ’Y’.
A ball is drawn at random from the
urn, its mark is noted down and it is replaced.
If 6 balls are drawn in this way, find the
probability that:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item all will bear 'X' mark.
    \item not more than 2 will bear 'Y' mark.
    \item at least one ball will bear 'Y' mark.
    \item the number of balls with 'X' mark and 'Y' mark will be equal.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Solution:}
Let X be the number of balls which have 'X' mark on them\\
Using the expression of binomial distribution
\[P(X = r) = {n \choose r} p^r q^{n-r}\]
We have
\[n = 6\]
\[p = \frac{2}{5} = 0.4\] 
\[q = \frac{3}{5} = 0.6\] 
For \((i)\) we need to find \(P(X = 6)\)
\[P(X = 6) = {6 \choose 6} p^6 q^0 = \left(\frac{2}{5} \right)^6 = 0.004096\]
For \((ii)\) we need to find \(P(X \geq 4)\)
\[P(X \geq 4) = \sum_{r = 4}^6 {6 \choose r} p^r q^{n-r} = 0.1792\]
For \((iii)\) we need to find \(P(X \leq 5)\)
\[P(X \leq 5) = \sum_{r = 0}^5 {6 \choose r} p^r q^{n - r} = 0.995904\]
For \((iv)\) we need to find \(P(X = 3)\)
\[P(X = 3) = {6 \choose 3} p^3 q^3 = 0.27648\]
